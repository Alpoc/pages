### Introduction

Self driving and navigation is and has been a goal for many individuals and companies for quite a few years now. From autonomous cars to robots that can navigate our world there are so many tasks that have consumed too many man hours. The fun of this challenge is it is still unsolved. Autonomous robots path planning can still be improved, self driving cars are only recently sharing the roads with us in very limited fashions. Many of the limitations have been in hardware. There are still many hardware limitations but as hardware improves we can push our algorithms and models.
 
2004 sparked the start of DARPA’s Grand Challenge. While no car completed the challenge it was a good start to initiating the research into self driving cars. Hardware at the time was very limited. In DARPA’s final report it lists the vehicles hardware ranging from the meager laser rangefinders and ultrasonic sensors to the expensive LiDARs. Not much about the hardware is stated but Graphics cards at the time were not being used yet for neural networks [Using GPUs for Machine Learning Algorithms, 2005].
 
 While today LiDARs are becoming more financially attainable, good ones are still too expensive for mass production and they are still a bit bulky. While they may be large and relatively expensive they are still currently the go to option for self driving companies such as Waymo and Chevy. Waymo is at the forefront of self driving and proudly sitting on top of their vehicles is a massive LiDAR. Waymo for the most part likes to stay under the radar. ![picture of waymo van](/assets/waymo_van.png)
