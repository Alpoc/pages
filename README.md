Introduction:
	Self driving and navigation is and has been a goal for many individuals and companies for quite a few years now. From autonomous cars to robots that can navigate our world there are so many tasks that have consumed too many man hours. The fun of this challenge is it is still unsolved. Autonomous robots path planning can still be improved, self driving cars are only recently sharing the roads with us in very limited fashions. Many of the limitations have been in hardware. There are still many hardware limitations but as hardware improves we can push our algorithms and models.
